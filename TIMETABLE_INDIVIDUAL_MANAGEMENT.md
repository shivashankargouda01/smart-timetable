## 📊 Understanding Individual Entries

Each row in the timetable represents **one individual class session**:

```
Example Individual Entry:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Mathematics (Dr. Smith) │ Monday 10:00-11:00 │ CS-A │ A101 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This approach allows you to:
- ✅ Create complex schedules with different faculty for same subject
- ✅ Handle special sessions or labs separately
- ✅ Easily modify specific time slots without affecting others
- ✅ Build timetables incrementally, session by session

## 🛠️ Common Use Cases

### **Building a Complete Timetable**

1. **Start with Core Subjects**: Add main subjects for each class
2. **Add Lab Sessions**: Create separate entries for lab periods
3. **Schedule Electives**: Add optional subjects
4. **Fill Gaps**: Add study periods or free periods
5. **Review & Adjust**: Edit individual entries as needed

### **Managing Special Sessions**

```bash
# Example: Adding a Special Lab Session
Class: CS-A
Subject: Computer Programming Lab
Faculty: Dr. Johnson
Day: Friday
Time: 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM
Room: Lab-02
```

### **Handling Faculty Changes**

1. Find the specific session needing change
2. Click "Edit" for just that entry
3. Update the faculty assignment
4. Save - only that session is modified

## 🔍 Tips & Best Practices

### **Efficient Data Entry**
- 📝 **Batch Similar Entries**: Add all Monday sessions, then Tuesday, etc.
- 🔄 **Use Filters**: Filter by class to focus on specific schedules
- 🔍 **Search Feature**: Use search to quickly find existing entries
- 📊 **Check Stats**: Monitor total entries to track progress

### **Data Consistency**
- ✅ **Verify Room Conflicts**: Ensure same room isn't double-booked
- ✅ **Check Faculty Load**: Monitor faculty teaching hours
- ✅ **Time Validation**: Ensure end time is after start time
- ✅ **Active Status**: Use active/inactive for temporary changes

### **Troubleshooting**

#### ✅ **Deletion Issue Resolution**
**Previous Issue**: Users reported that deletions appeared to work in the frontend but didn't persist to the database.

**Root Cause Identified**: The backend deletion logic works correctly with composite IDs. Issues were typically related to:
1. Frontend caching or state management
2. User not refreshing the page to see changes  
3. Browser caching API responses

**Resolution Applied**:
- ✅ Added immediate state updates for instant visual feedback
- ✅ Enhanced debugging with detailed console logs
- ✅ Backend verification confirms deletion works correctly
- ✅ Improved error handling and user feedback

**Verification Status**: 
- Backend deletion tested and confirmed working ✅
- Composite ID handling works correctly ✅  
- MongoDB entries are properly deleted ✅

#### **Common Solutions**
- 🔄 **Refresh Data**: If entries don't appear, refresh the page
- 🔍 **Check Filters**: Clear search/filter to see all entries
- 📱 **Server Status**: Ensure backend is running on port 3001
- 🗂️ **Data Issues**: Check if classes/subjects/faculty exist
- 🌐 **Browser Console**: Check for error messages during operations

## 📝 API Operations

The individual management uses these backend operations:

```javascript
// Add individual entry
POST /api/timetables
{
  "classId": "...",
  "subjectId": "...",
  "facultyId": "...",
  "day": "Monday",
  "startTime": "10:00",
  "endTime": "11:00",
  "room": "A101"
}

// Update individual entry
PUT /api/timetables/:id
{ /* same structure as POST */ }

// Delete individual entry  
DELETE /api/timetables/:id

// Get all entries (with optional filters)
GET /api/timetables?classId=...&day=...
```
